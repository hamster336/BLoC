# bloc_basics

A new Flutter project.

This is a very basic project that has three screens: A HomeScreen through which we can navigate to either the BlocScreen or the CubitScreen.

Both the BlocScreen and CubitScreen has the same layout and funcionality: incrementing or decrementing a counter on the press of a button. For this, i have used both Bloc and Cubit to handle both the events of incrementing and decrementing. This project served as a hands-on introduction to a new Flutter state management technique.
